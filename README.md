# Zipper-

This is a software that enables one to zip(archive) one or more files together, or entire an entire folder. Also enables one to extract files from any archived document to any desired location.

This program can be run through command line on windows or its analogous on Mac or any python IDE( Pycharm , etc)

Note that file path must contain '\\' in place of '\'
eg. "C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\foldername\filename.pdf" is the file path. 
this must be entered as C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents\\foldername\\filename.pdf in the program.

Support for this manual task will soon be updated.
Any comments, improvements are always welcome.
